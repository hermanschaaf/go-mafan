Mafan
============

Mafan is a Go package for handling everything in Chinese text processing that just makes your life `mafan` (troublesome). It can split strings into words, do parts-of-speech tagging, handling file encodings and more.

Well, right now it does none of that, but that's where it is headed, starting with splitting of strings of Chinese text into words.

This package is the Golang rewrite (not a port) of the original Python parent-project, also called [Mafan](http://github.com/hermanschaaf/mafan).
